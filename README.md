The extension handles the SPA behavior of GitHub website from `v3.0.0` onwards :)

**_Note:_** For private repos([Issue #6](https://github.com/softvar/enhanced-github/issues/6)), GitHub Access Token is required. Follow the steps [mentioned below](#github-api-rate-limiting) to add your GitHub Access Token.

### Permissions required

- `"*://*.github.com/*"` - for running on `github.com` domain.
- `storage` - for storing GitHub access token on your local system. GitHub Access token is required for private repos and for handling API rate-limiting issues.
- `webRequest` - to support GitHub being a single-page-application now. Read this [detailed blog](https://medium.com/@softvar/making-chrome-extension-smart-by-supporting-spa-websites-1f76593637e8).
- `webNavigation` - to support GitHub being a single-page-application now. Read this [detailed blog](https://medium.com/@softvar/making-chrome-extension-smart-by-supporting-spa-websites-1f76593637e8).

## GitHub API Rate Limiting

Since this extension fetches data using GitHub public v3 API for showing file _size_ and _download_url_, it consumes free quota which is very less [GitHub API Rate Limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/).

To tackle this, create a new GitHub Access Token.

1. If logged-in, visit [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate a new token, select `repo` scope and create it.
3. Copy and store the generated token which looks something like: `17c1a8d5b399d66b6212382d98d4c67a94d58955` (a fake one :P).
4. Click on extension icon and then on `Settings-Options` on top right.

   OR

   Right click on enhanced-github extension and and click on `Options` in the dropdown menu.

5. Enter the valid GitHub Access Token
6. Click on `SAVE` and Enjoy the benefits.

This Chrome extension will automatically pick this valid access token and Bingo!
